# javascript-challenge

For this challenge: 

    * I used the index.html file provided (with a few edits!).

    * I used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, and wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.


    * I used a date form in my HTML document, and wroe JavaScript code that senses events and searches through the 'datetime' column to find rows that match user input
